# Intro to Keras Tuner

## Instructions

In this lab, you will get some hands-on practice with Keras Tuner. This package allows you to automatically tune your model's hyperparameters so you can optimize your model training. It alleviates the difficulty of figuring out the hyperparameters by hand which, as mentioned in the lectures, is not scalable. You will just build a simple model here but feel free to try it out in your own projects and see if you get better results.
