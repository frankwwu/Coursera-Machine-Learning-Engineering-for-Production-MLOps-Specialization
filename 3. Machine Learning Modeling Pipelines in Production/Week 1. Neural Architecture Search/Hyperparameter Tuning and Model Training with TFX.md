# Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Training with TFX

## Instructions

In this lab, you will revisit machine learning pipelines using TFX (from Course 2 of this specialization) and add two more components: Tuner and Trainer. These will basically do the same things you did in the previous ungraded lab but you will need to be mindful of the data formats and accessing component artifacts. At the end of this exercise, you should be able to build a machine learning pipeline that includes hyperparameter tuning and model training.
