# Distributed Strategies with TF and Keras

## Instructions

During this ungraded lab you are going to perform a distributed training strategy using TensorFlow and Keras, specifically  the tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy.

You will perform training with a single worker. Then you will learn about the requirements for a multi-worker setup and implement a multi-worker strategy by simulating different machines through magic commands.
