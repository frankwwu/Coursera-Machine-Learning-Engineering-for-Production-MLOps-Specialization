# Model Analysis with TFX Evaluator

## Instructions

For this exercise, you will see how model evaluation fits in a TFX pipeline through the Evaluator component. This uses TFMA under the hood so you will recognize its outputs when you visualize it. You will also see how a serving signature uses the Transform output graph and how baseline models are automatically detected with the  Resolver component. These will help you prepare your model for deployment and ensure that it is meeting the metrics threshold you specified.
