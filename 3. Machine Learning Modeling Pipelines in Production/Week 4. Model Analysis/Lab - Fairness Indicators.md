# Fairness Indicators

## Instructions

Production ML requires a commitment to fairness to ensure a good experience for all your users. Including fairness metrics analysis in your workflow should help you detect if your model is discriminating against a particular feature slice. In this lab, you will:

use the Fairness Indicators suite of tools to analyze a model based on common fairness metrics

create and train a model on image data then feed it to TFMA for deeper analysis

visualize the metrics on a specified feature slice and investigate the results
