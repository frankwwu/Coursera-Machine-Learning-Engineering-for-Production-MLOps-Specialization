# Tensorflow Model Analysis

## Instructions

In this lab, you will practice using Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA) to compute and visualize metrics across different slices of your data. This is an important step in production systems since you don't want to deploy a model that will only work well for a particular case or just a subset of your potential users. More so, this kind of analysis can be crucial in applications where fairness is a top priority. TFMA allows you to set up the feature slices you want to monitor and quickly spot where your model is having issues. Let's begin!
