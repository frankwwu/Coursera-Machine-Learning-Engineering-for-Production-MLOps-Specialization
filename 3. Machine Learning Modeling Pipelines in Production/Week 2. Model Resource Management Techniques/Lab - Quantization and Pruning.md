# Quantization and Pruning

## Instructions

In this Colab, you will get hands-on practice with model quantization and pruning. You will build a simple Keras model then measure the effects of post-training quantization, quantization aware training, and weight pruning by comparing the model size and accuracy of the optimized models.
