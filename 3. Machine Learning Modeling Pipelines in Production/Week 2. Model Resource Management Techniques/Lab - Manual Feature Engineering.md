# Manual Feature Engineering

## Instructions

During this ungraded lab you are going to perform feature engineering using TensorFlow and Keras.  This is closely tied to dimensionality reduction since the transformation from raw to engineered features usually yields a lower number of features. This is a result of combining raw features to create more robust ones. Features might also be dropped during this process aiding the dimensionality reduction.
