# Algorithmic Dimensionality Reduction

## Instructions

During this ungraded lab you are going to experiment with some algorithms that aim to reduce the dimensionality of data. You will be using scikit-learn to implement three of these algorithms on three different types of data:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on numerical data.

Single Value Decomposition (SVD) on image data

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on text data.
