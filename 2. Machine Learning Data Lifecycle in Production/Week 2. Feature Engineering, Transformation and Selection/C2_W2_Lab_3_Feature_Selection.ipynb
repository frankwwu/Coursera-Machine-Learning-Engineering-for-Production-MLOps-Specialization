    "Feature selection involves picking the set of features that are most relevant to the target variable. This helps in reducing the complexity of your model, as well as minimizing the resources required for training and inference. This has greater effect in production models where you maybe dealing with terabytes of data or serving millions of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will run through the different techniques in performing feature selection on the [Breast Cancer Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29). Most of the modules will come from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), one of the most commonly used machine learning libraries. It features various machine learning algorithms and has built-in implementations of different feature selection methods. Using these, you will be able to compare which method works best for this particular dataset."

    "\n",
    "L1 or Lasso Regulartization introduces a penalty term to the loss function which leads to the least important features being eliminated. Implementation in scikit-learn can be done with a [LinearSVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html) model as the learning algorithm. You can then use [SelectFromModel](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html) to select features based on the LinearSVC model’s output of L1 regularization.

    "With these results and also your domain knowledge, you can decide which set of features to use to train on the entire dataset. If you will be basing it on the f1 score, you may narrow it down to the `Strong features`, `Subset features` and `F-test` rows because they have the highest scores. If you want to save resources, the `F-test` will be the most optimal of these 3 because it uses the least number of features (unless you did the bonus challenge and removed more from `Subset features`). On the other hand, if you find that all the resulting scores for all approaches are acceptable, then you may just go for the method with the smallest set of features."

As shown, you can do quick experiments with these because convenience modules are already available in libraries like sci-kit learn. It is a good idea to do this preprocessing step because not only will you save resources, you may even get better results than when you use all features. Try it out on your previous/upcoming projects and see what results you get!"
