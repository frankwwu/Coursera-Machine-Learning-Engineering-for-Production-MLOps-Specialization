# Data Labeling

##Instructions

[Launch Notebook!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-production/ungradedLab/hnDmK/data-labeling/lab)

In this ungraded you will see how the **labeling process** affects the performance of Machine Learning algorithms and the importance of establishing baselines to measure this change in performance. In particular you will:

- Define performance baselines using the true labels and random labeling 

- Simulate different labelers that label the data based on different labeling rules

- Try out your own labeling rules

**Have fun with the lab!**
